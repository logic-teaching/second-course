Likewise thanks to Ian Boon and Tristen Cardwell and Zeynep Yıldız for talking through this material in the course of teaching it with me the first couple of times around. Thanks to the wonderful tutors Yasmine Ardehali, Lauren August, Scott Blomgren, Rocky Klein, Jordan Nakdimon, Elsa Servantez, Declan Trudel, and Quinton Wood for working through the "more practice problems" documents with students.

Much of it is based off of [my previous materials](https://carnap.io/shared/logiclogiclogic/book-mainpage.pandoc) when I did both the first and second logic course in adjacent terms.

<br>

This is a second course in logic, which focuses on the semantics and deductive systems for predicate logic. It presupposes some prior familiarity with propositional logic, but largely just builds everything from scratch.

It was built for a ten week course, where it could not be presupposed that the students had all taken a first logic course together, and indeed in many cases they took their first logic courses at different institutions.

Each chapter corresponds to a week's worth of materials, with two lectures, and two sets of practice problems. For many of these, there is a "Solution" link next to it, which is just like the page to its immediate left, but with the solutions filled in or indicated. The version without the solutions was often used when presenting the material, alongside working it out by hand.
